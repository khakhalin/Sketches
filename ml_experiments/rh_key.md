# Biostats Exam, Fall 2019

The Dutchy of Red Hoek is plagued by lycantropy.

Not a month would pass without someone going berserk on a full moon, transforming into a scary, furry creature. There is no peace in the Dutchy of Red Hoek, and many a family is broken apart by this horrible affliction.

The duke of Red Hoek decided to call for mædecinal stætisticians to study the lycantropy in his feode. The stætisticians did come, and recorded every person in the Duke's feode:
where they work, and are they a lad or a lass, and how many summers they count since the day that they were born into this world. And for each of these people, the stætisticians measured the amount of lycantropcites in a pint of their blood. (Aye, they drew a pint of their blood. People of the Dutchy of Red Hoek are strong in body in spirit!) They called this number a "baseline", and wrote it down in their stætistical books, as it is well known that the more lycantropcites you have, the sicker you are, and closer to turning into a werewolf.

Then they ordered every person to change their ways, and either start eating a clove of garlic every day, or rub their feet and neck with a silver spatula every day, for a quarter of an hour, as they say their morning prayers.

Three months later the stætisticians returned, and measured the amount of lycantropcites in a pint of blood once again. Looking for a difference.

Equipped with the knowledge of R, and a hunger for truth, help the Duke of Red Hoek to answer the following three questions:

1. Does the person's occupation matter, or do people get sick regardless of what they do?
2. Which gender is more susceptible to the affliction?
3. Did the treatments work, and if so, which one is more promising?

For each question, prepare at least one nice figure, and a paragraph to accompany this figure (or figures). If to answer a question you had to compare several different analyses, illustrate and describe all of them.

Make sure to describe really well what you did, how, and why. The steps, and the necessary logic.
When running analysis of variance, don't assume that the reader will guess the model; explicitly describe the model in words. If your text sounds more like a "results" section, or even a discussion, rather than a figure caption, this is fine. You don't have to go for one-liners! And if you found an interesting pattern, or have some thoughts about the data and your analysis of it, write them down, even if you were not explicitly asked about it.

Add your R code to your write-up, so that your instructor could check it if necessary.

Combine the figures, the captions, and the code into one PDF document and submit it by email (khakhalin@bard.edu)

Good luck, and may the Light be with you!
